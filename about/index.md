I'm a committer of the [Apache Mesos] project, and work as a Distributed Systems
Engineer at [Mesosphere]. Within the realm of computer science, I'm very much
intrigued by language design, compiler construction, and distributed systems.

I take special interest in C++, and am an active member of the ISO C++ Standards
Committee.
