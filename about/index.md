I'm a committer for the [Apache Mesos] project, and work as a Distributed
Systems Engineer at [Mesosphere]. Within the realm of computer science, I'm very
much intrigued by language design, compiler construction, and distributed
systems. I'm also an active member of the ISO C++ Standards Committee.
