## Introduction

A few weeks ago, the Fall 2018 C++ Committee meeting took place in San Diego.
It was a record-breaking meeting with __274__ papers submitted to the
pre-meeting mailing and 180 people in attendance. As the number of authors grow,
there seems to be an increasing interest in easily creating beautiful documents.

The format of papers vary widely - Plain Text, HTML, LaTeX, Bikeshed, MS Word,
etc. Personally, I prefer the look and stability of a PDF document generated
from LaTeX. My first paper, [N3887] was indeed written in LaTeX: [N3887.latex].

But writing LaTeX is a real pain. I couldn't transfer my thoughts into LaTeX
directly so I ended up writing in Google Docs first then __converting__ to LaTeX
afterwards. This was completely unreasonable so I started looking for ways to
write Markdown instead. I soon came across [Pandoc], which is a Swiss army
knife that can convert basically any document format to another.

[N3887]: https://wg21.link/N3887
[N3887.latex]: https://github.com/mpark/wg21/blob/master/N3887.latex
[Pandoc]: https://pandoc.org

Today, I write my papers in Markdown, which gets translated to LaTeX then
generated into a PDF document. Here's the Tony Table for a snippet of [P0655R1]:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th markdown="1">
[P0655R1.pandoc](https://github.com/mpark/wg21/blob/master/P0655R1.pandoc)
</th>
<th markdown="1">
[P0655R1.pdf][P0655R1]
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<td width="46%" markdown="1">

</td>
<td width="54%" markdown="1">
[![P0655R1-pdf]][P0655R1-pdf]
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Project Structure

The paper sources live at [mpark/wg21], and all of the relevant templates live
in the [`template`][template] directory. Given a [Pandoc Markdown] file
`<paper>.pandoc` at the top-level, `make <paper>.pdf` generates PDF document via
LaTeX at `pdf/<paper>.pdf` and `make <paper>.md` generates
[Github Flavored Markdown] at `github/<paper>.md`.

The following sections cover common elements and scenarios in C++ paper writing.

## Title

The title is generated by a YAML metadata block.

```yaml
---
title: "`visit<R>`: Explicit Return Type for `visit`"
document: P0655R1
date: 2018-07-09
audience: Library Evolution Group
author:
  - name: Michael Park
    email: <mcypark@gmail.com>
  - name: Agustín Bergé
    email: <agustinberge@gmail.com>
---
```

## Table of Contents

The table of contents can be generated by setting `toc: true` in
the YAML metadata block.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th markdown="1">
[P1260R0.pandoc](https://github.com/mpark/wg21/blob/master/P1260R0.pandoc)
</th>
<th markdown="1">

<tbody>

<td width="50%" markdown="1">

<td width="50%" markdown="1">

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

[P1260R0]: https://wg21.link/P1260R0
[P1260R0-toc]: /images/P1260R0-toc.png

The default depth is `3`, but it can be modified with `toc-depth: <N>`.

## Markdown

For most of the document content itself, you should simply reach for the basic
Markdown functionalities you probably already know, such as headers, lists,
quotes, fenced code blocks, inline formatting (bold, italics, strikeout), etc.

You can also refer to the full [Pandoc Markdown] specification for extensions!

## Code Examples

Code examples are written with `cpp` code blocks as you normally would.
The thing to note is that the annotations that appear time to time
in "Standardese C++" such as **_see below_**, **_unspecified_**, and
**_INVOKE_** are formatted automatically without any decorations in the code.

``````
```cpp
  template <class F, class... BoundArgs>
    unspecified bind(F&&, BoundArgs&&...);
  template <class R, class F, class... BoundArgs>
    unspecified bind(F&&, BoundArgs&&...);
```
``````

[![P0655R1-code]][P0655R1-code]

[P0655R1-code]: /images/P0655R1-code.png

Of course that means if you name a variable `unspecified`, it'll unintentionally
be italicized. At least for now... just, don't do that 😅.

## Tony Tables

Tony Tables are before/after tables showing the code we had to write without
the proposed feature, and the code we get to write with the proposed feature.

> if you don't have Tony Tables in your paper, you're likely not communicating

Tony Tables are [fenced `Div` blocks][DivSpan] that open with `::: tonytable`
and close with `:::`. [Fenced code blocks][Code] are the only elements that
actually get added to Tony Tables, except that the last header (if any) before
a [fenced code block][Code] is attached to the cell above.

Here is an example Tony Table:

``````
::: tonytable

### Before
```cpp
switch (x) {
  case 0: std::cout << "got zero"; break;
  case 1: std::cout << "got one"; break;
  default: std::cout << "don't care";
}
```

### After
```cpp
inspect (x) {
  0: std::cout << "got zero";
  1: std::cout << "got one";
  _: std::cout << "don't care";
}
```

:::
``````

[![tonytable-simple]][tonytable-simple]

[tonytable-simple]: /images/tonytable-simple.png

Each [fenced code block][Code] element is pushed onto the current row of the table, and
[horizontal rules] (`---`) are used to move to the next row. You can also
control the width of a column by adding a `width=<float>` attribute to a header.

[Code]: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#fenced-code-blocks
[horizontal rules]: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#horizontal-rules

Here is a more elaborate example:

``````
::: tonytable

### Before {width=.53}
```cpp
std::visit([&](auto&& x) {
  strm << "got auto: " << x;
}, v);
```

### After {width=.47}
```cpp
inspect (v) {
  <auto> x: strm << "got auto: " << x;
}
```

---

```cpp
std::visit([&](auto&& x) {
  using X = std::remove_cvref_t<decltype(x)>;
  if constexpr (C1<X>()) {
    strm << "got C1: " << x;
  } else if constexpr (C2<X>()) {
    strm << "got C2: " << x;
  }
}, v);
```

```cpp
inspect (v) {
  <C1> c1: strm << "got C1: " << c1;
  <C2> c2: strm << "got C2: " << c2;
}
```

:::
``````

## Proposed Wording

This section of the paper is generally where most diffs (code and wording) appear.

### Code Changes

Code changes are written with `diff` code blocks as you normally would.
  - Unchanged: No marker
  - Added: `+` marker
  - Removed: `-` marker

``````
```diff
// 20.3.4: tuple-like access to pair:
template <size_t I, class T1, class T2>
-  constexpr typename tuple_element<I, std::pair<T1, T2> >::type&
+  constexpr tuple_element_t<I, pair<T1, T2> >&
-    get(std::pair<T1, T2>&) noexcept;
+    get(pair<T1, T2>&) noexcept;
```
``````

### Wording Changes

Wording changes are written with [fenced `Div` blocks][DivSpan]
(similar to Tony Tables) for large changes or [bracketed `Span`][DivSpan]
for small changes.

[Fenced `Div` blocks][DivSpan] open with `::: add` or `::: rm` and close with `:::`:

```
> \pnum{1} Let _n_ be `sizeof...(Variants)`. Let `m` be a pack of _n_ values of type
> `size_t`. Such a pack is called valid if $0 \leq$ `m`_~i~_ <
> `variant_size_v<remove_reference_t<Variants`_~i~_`>>` for all $0 \leq i < n$.
> For each valid pack `m`, let _e_(`m`) denote the expression:
>
> > \small _`INVOKE`_`(std::forward<Visitor>(vis), get<m>(std::forward<Variants>(vars))...)` _// see 19.14.3_
>
> ::: add
> for the first form and
>
> > \small _`INVOKE`_`<R>(std::forward<Visitor>(vis), get<m>(std::forward<Variants>(vars))...)` _// see 19.14.3_
>
> for the second form.
> :::
```

[![div-diff]][div-diff]

[div-diff]: /images/div-diff.png

[Bracketed `Span`][DivSpan] either looks like `[<new text>]{.add}` or `[<old text>]{.rm}`.

```
> \pnum{3} _Returns:_ _e_(`m`), where `m` is the pack for which `m`_~i~_ is
> `vars`_~i~_`.index()` for all $0 \leq i < n$. The return type is
> `decltype(`_e_(`m`)`)` [for the first form]{.add}.
```

### Grammar Changes

Grammar changes are written with [line blocks] (`|`) in order to preserve the leading spaces.

[line blocks]: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#line-blocks

```
> | *selection-statement:*
> |     `if constexpr`*~opt~* `(` *init-statement~opt~* *condition* `)` *statement*
> |     `if constexpr`*~opt~* `(` *init-statement~opt~* *condition* `)` *statement* `else` *statement*
> |     `switch (` *init-statement~opt~* *condition* `)` *statement*
> |     [`inspect constexpr`*~opt~* `(` *init-statement~opt~* *condition* `) {` *inspect-case-seq* `}`]{.add}

# Introduction

This paper is inspired by [@N3655], section 3 of which was adopted at WG21's
2013 Bristol meeting. That section provided (as did its predecessor [@N3546])
template aliases for the result of _metafunctions_ in `<type_traits>`.
However, the broader question of analogous template aliases throughout
the remainder of the standard library was not addressed.

## Final Remarks

In this post, I've covered the common elements that I've needed writing papers.
Writing papers in Markdown has been a sigfinicant improvement for me in smoothly
transferring my thoughts onto a paper. Perhaps it'll be helpful to others as
a framework as well 🙂

Also, most of what's being done here is just [Pandoc] out of the box.
Kudos to the [Pandoc] developers for an amazing tool!
