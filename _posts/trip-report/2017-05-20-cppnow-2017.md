I just returned from C++Now 2017 in Aspen, CO. This was my second time attending
the conference and it was just as amazing as last year. My girlfriend decided to
come along this time, since Aspen is such a beautiful place. We flew into Denver,
rented a car and took the beautiful 4-hour drive into Aspen.
She was very happy ðŸ™ƒ. Strongly recommended!

The week started like this:

## Talks

Here are most of the talks I attended, in chronological order.

##### [C++17 Features][cpp17-features] - Bryce Lelbach

  Bryce took a breadth-first approach of exploring C++17 features that are
  around the corner. They took a form of ["Tony Tables"][tony-tables], where we
  saw a simple before-and-after of each feature. I was glad to find many
  compelling examples delievered in the talk. It helped me remind myself that
  although we didn't get many of the major language features we were hoping for,
  we still got a lot of useful features into the language. A few highlights:

  - __Language__: [structured bindings][structured-bindings],
                  [`if constexpr`][if-constexpr],
                  [class template deduction][class-template-deduction]
  - __Library__: [`filesystem`][filesystem],
                 [`string_view`][string_view],
                 [`optional`][optional],
                 [`variant`][variant],
                 [`any`][any],

##### [Expression Templates Everywhere with C++14 and Yap][expr-template] - Zach Laine

  Zach presented his expression template library called [Yap][yap]. It's being
  proposed as a boost library as a modernization of [Boost.Proto][boost-proto].
  He covered some of the common and compelling use cases of expression templates
  in the domain of mathematics, then went on to describe the machinery of yap.

  If I need expression templates soon (and I think I might), I'm glad to know
  that there's a modern libray solution for it ðŸ˜Š.

##### [constexpr ALL the things!][constexpr-all] - Ben Deane, Jason Turner

  Ben and Jason shared their experience in pushing the boundaries of
  `constexpr`. Exploring containers that can be used during compile-time and
  run-time, enumerating standard algorithms that can / should be marked
  `constexpr`, and standard defects (probably?) such as `std::pair`'s
  `operator=` not being marked `constexpr`. The relaxed `constexpr` in C++14
  made these `constexpr`s relevant, because now things can be modified, as long
  as they happen __within__ a `constexpr` function.

  The highlight of the talk was the compile-time parser framework built by Ben
  to parse JSON at compile-time. This was of particular interest to me because
  I've written a compile-time parser myself to parse format strings in
  experimenting with [mpark/format]. Needless to say, this was a very engaging
  talk for me.

##### [The Mathematical Underpinnings of Promises in C++][math-underpinnings] - David Sankel

  David talked about the mathematical approach of reasoning about futures and
  promises (although he sticks to calling them just promises). We first learned
  about denotational semantics and found that it's not quite sufficient due to
  the introduction of time; we then moved onto using operational semantics to
  tackle the issue.

  This talk was mainly focused on math, but it lead into his follow-up talk,
  [Promises in C++: The Universal Glue for Asynchronous Programs][promises-in-cpp],
  in which he describes his [open source promise library][dplp] that is based on
  this mathematical backing.

##### [Postmodern Immutable Data Structures][immutable-data] - Juan Pedro Bolivar Puente

  Juan presented his persistent, immutable data structures library called
  [immer]. Functional languages have been promoting value semantics since the
  1950s, and was part of C++ since its initial design. Most of us love value
  semantics because of the referential transparency it provides, making our
  programs much easier to reason about.

  The issue of performance has gotten in the way of using value semantics in
  the past, and move semantics in C++11 made that __a lot__ more practical.
  Juan takes this further by allowing objects to share views of common
  subcomponents. The result is that we get very efficient data structures that
  are very fast to compare, with a compact undo-history.

  He also presented [ewig], a text editor using these data structures.
  [Demo] involves opening and editing a very larg file.
  Two things stood out to me:

  - The text editor displays an asterisk when the file has been modified but not
    yet saved. When it is modified to be the same state as the original,
    the asterisk disappears immediately. This may not seem like a big deal,
    but it demonstrates that the original stayed in tact, and that
    the comparison is super fast.

  - Juan copy-pasted a large portion of the file a bunch of times, and the
    editor handled that with no problem whatsoever. He then stopped and told
    us something along the lines of, "at this point, if we were to save this
    file and re-open it, we wouldn't have enough memory to read it back in".

    Impressive.

##### [Type Based Template Metaprogramming is Not Dead][type-based-meta] - Odin Holmes

  Odin presented [kvasir], the fastest metaprogramming library out there,
  competing against others like [meta], [metal], [mp11], and [brigand].
  According to [metaben.ch], it's the fastest in every algorithm except
  cartesian product. [metal] takes that one, but Odin had an excuse for it ðŸ˜œ.

  On a more serious note, he presented an empirical study of the cost of
  compile-time operations:

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Compile time costs of various TMP techniques <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cppnow?src=hash">#cppnow</a> <a href="https://t.co/PpudMV9hV5">pic.twitter.com/PpudMV9hV5</a></p>&mdash; Meeting C++ (@meetingcpp) <a href="https://twitter.com/meetingcpp/status/864987819172925440">May 17, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

  Strategically paying for the cheaper compile-time operations is the secret to
  [kvasir]'s efficiency. I'll need to remember this list to improve the
  compile-time for [mpark/variant]. Glad to have some general guidance here ðŸ˜€.

  Also, this was funny ðŸ˜‚:

Okay, back to the talks.

##### [Call: A Library that Will Change the Way You Think about Function Invocations][call] - Matt Calabrese

  Matt presented his experimental `call` library that explores the space of
  function invocation, which in my opinion is a bit of a mess in C++ land
  currently.

  Utilities such as [`std::apply`][apply], [`std::invoke`][invoke], and
  [`std::visit`][visit] all work great independently, but they don't compose
  all that well.

  He presented 3 hours worth of material, but this is the most basic issue:

  In Python, we can say:

```python
args = (1, 2, 3)
f(0, *args)
```

  In C++, we have...

```c++
auto args = make_tuple(1, 2, 3);
apply([](auto&... args) { return f(0, args...); }, args);
```

  This is way too complicated... With `call`, you can instead say:

```c++
auto args = make_tuple(1, 2, 3);
call(0, unpack(args));
```

  Much better. The library does __a lot__ more than this, but this is the
  beginning of its motivation.

  The talk is based on his standards paper: [A Single Generalization of
  std::invoke, std::apply, and std::visit][P0376].

##### [Practical (?) Applications of Reflection][reflection] - Jackie Kay

  Jackie talked about reflection in other languages, followed by a comparison of
  [P0194] "reflexpr" proposal, vs [P0590] "operator $" proposal. She pointed out
  that the proposals currently only support introspection, and that in order to
  do really interesting things we'd need more.

  She shared a bunch of examples that were tested with the current
  implementations in Clang, I'm really glad that she's investing time to get
  practical experience with the proposals.

  The talk is based on her popular blog posts:
  [An Introduction to Reflection in C++][refl1] and
  [Fun with Reflection in C++][refl2].

##### [Locally Atomic Capabilities and How to Count Them][local-atomic] - Lisa Lippincott

  I went to Lisa's talk last year, [What is the basic interface?][basic-interface]
  which won best session. This was a follow-up to that session, and it was just
  as engaging.

  <figure>
 	  <img src="/images/cppnow-2016-best-session.png" alt="C++Now 2016 Best Session" style="width:66%">
  </figure>

  She formally discusses the nature of capabilities of functions divided into
  different "neighborhoods". She makes an analogy to chemistry, where the
  essential atoms are preserved during the flow. In programming, "claim"s such
  as "destructible", and "deallocatable", exit a function like `new`, and enters
  a `delete`. By counting the flow of essential atoms, one can detect bugs that
  arise due to humans' poor ability to perform non-local reasoning.

  While I understood the gist of the talk, I'm sure I didn't fully follow.
  So I'm already looking forward to watching it again on YouTube ðŸ™‚.

## Beyond the Talks

The program was fantastic this year. Shout out to our program chair Bryce
Lelbach, and all the speakers for their spectacular material.

Having said that, the real reason I attend C++Now is not because of the talks.
As embarrassing as it is to admit, I missed __all__ of the keynotes this year.
But it's okay. I can catch those on YouTube.
(Sorry, keynote speakers! I'll catch you on YouTube, I promise.)

What I __cannot__ catch is the face-to-face interactions I get with the speakers
and attendees, many of whom I consider to be good friends. C++Now is
intentionally scheduled with a long lunch, and frequent, long breaks between
sessions. People also hang out at the bar in the evenings, most nights into
early morning. It's __ridiculous.__ I was up __every night__ until 2am - 4am,
discussing ideas, learning new concepts, having heated arguments, presenting my
thoughts, and listening where I'm a novice.

It's wonderful, and to me, this is the real magic of C++Now.

Also, a fun poll by Bryce, asking for the most desired features up to C++50:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Entirely non-serious C++-20 to C++-50 polls.

and a fun challenge:

Ah... what a week.

## My Contribution

I gave a lightning talk entitled "__MPark.Patterns__: Pattern Matching in C++14".

It's a brief introduction of [mpark/patterns] which I've been working on in
order to bring a clean pattern matching library to C++.

I started out with a few simple examples, and finished with a complex,
red-black tree balancing code at the end:

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kTSMC3hfUeXXvijp8Owi8t432s6CMiOUoUPLgD4oEHI/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="480" height="299" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

My general feeling was that it was well received. Michael Caisse asked people to
raise their hands if they thought the library was cool, and from what I saw, more
than half of the room raised their hand! ðŸ˜€

There's some stuff that I didn't get to present in the 5-minutes, of course.
For example, the `sum` pattern allows matching on `variant`-like types, and
the `variadic` pattern allows the power to implement [`std::apply`][apply],
and [`std::visit`][visit]. The real power of course is not just the ability to
implement them, but rather the ability to __compose__ them.

I'm planning to continue my work here and give a full session in the future. ðŸ¤“
